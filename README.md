# NoshowMedicalAppointments

The dataset being analysed here has information collected  from 110527 medical appointments in Brazil from ('2016-04-29') to ('2016-06-08') and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

Problem: A significant number of patients book an appointment with a doctor and end up not showing up on scheduled day.

Objective of the analysis: Find out which factors, if any, influence the showing up or lack of showing up of the patients who have shecuduled medical appointments?
